plan:
	updated 7/29

	initial release: since i think that it is essential to get the app out there in use right as the semester starts (as that's when there is the most free food), it will initially only be for iowa state. 
		essential features: 
			you can see a list of food sites, current and future
			you can add food sites
			it is ok for location to be plain text

		features to add as quickly as possible:
			reputation: each time a user reports that a site really exists or doesn't, the poster's reputation will be updated
			save each new location as a location object
			ads

		later:
			detect coordinates and find closest colleges or allow to add new college
